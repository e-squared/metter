*Letter Metadata Prototype* (shortened to *metter*) is a web-based proof-of-concept tool for capturing correspondence metadata, keeping its focus on usability and efficiency. It is part of an on-going research project and is a work in progress. You can see the application in action at [http://metter.uzi.uni-halle.de/][1].

Letter Metadata Prototype was created as part of the project [Epistolary Networks][1]. The project investigates the correspondences and social networks of German scholars which went into exile during Nazi Germany. The project was funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) [grant number 01UG1354C]. The project is a collaboration between the [Trier Center for Digital Humanities][3], [Deutsches Literaturarchiv Marbach][4], and the [Martin-Luther-University Halle-Wittenberg][5]. 

Please note that due to its prototypical nature, this tool does not save anything when clicking on the submit button.
